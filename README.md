- Nice minimalistic UI design that changes colour depending on the time of day

## To do
- Fix some errors / bugs like the error display
- Forecast graph with information.
- Automatically get weather of a city via IP.
- Improved visual e.g animations.
- Use server side code to hide api keys etc and do other useful standard practices.
- Or begin new project and learn to learn server side code, useful standard practices and apis.
